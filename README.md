### BOOFLIX

**DESCRIPTION:**

Application linking to the _TMDB_api_ .

Once you have made a simulation of login, the app will start showing the Top Rated both of the category films that series.

Through the search input we can find every item available in the catalog and filter everything by genre.

I can also scroll through the pages, if they are available, to see more results.

Each element displayed will be composed of its own poster, which will reveal title, language, rating, and plot.

I can also request to view the cast by clicking on the appropriate button.

With the WATCH button I will be opened a new window with a Google search on the streaming sites for the selected title.

Through the dropdown menu in the user icon, I can also log out.
